Enrichment of 3 tables of GTFS STM database by using Scala io with Generic MapJoin &amp; Generic NestedLoopJoin

# Data set
I use STM GTFS data set. In this project, we continue the practice of enrichment (the most common data transformation task to do). To download the dataset, visit http://www.stm.info/en/about/developers

# Description
Enrich route with trip based on route_id and then enrich the result with Calendar based on service_id. At the end, you should write the final result in a CSV file with a proper header.
Parse trips data and enrich it with routes and calendar information. Note that here we create a new object that has information of trip, routes and calendar. Itâ€™s possible to do both joins at the same time. But, for simplicity, do one at a time. Hence, you will have an intermediate class as well.
a.	Trip
b.	Calendar
c.	Route
d.	TripRoute (intermediate class)
e.	EnrichedTrip (final class)

# Bonus
Generic Join functions that can be used for any kind of data sets.

# Output 
Trip + (MapJoin) + Route ---> TripRoute ---> TripRoute + (NestedLoopJoin) + Calendar ---> EnrichedTrip
